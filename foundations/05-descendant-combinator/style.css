div .text {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: red;
    font-size: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}
/* by putting div before the .text we're indicating that it's the 
parent/ancestor more technically we're saying the .text class has to be
nested inside a div type*/
/* p .text {
    declarations
    } 
    wouldn't work because the css is expecting a .text class nested
    inside a p, which we don't have here*/
/* ".container .text" or "div p" both work perfectly as indicated in the
README file, but i'm just feeling adventurous, ".container p" would work too
